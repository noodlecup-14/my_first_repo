        <p>My journey toward ICT has not been a straightforward one. 
          <br>
          I first studied and completed my Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration in Vietnam. 
          After graduation, I worked for around three years as a ship chandler in a supply company. 
          Alongside that, I also studied art by myself and ended up working as a freelance 2D illustrator and 2D animator, 
          which allowed me to combine creativity with problem-solving in a different way. 
          <br>
          When I moved to the Netherlands to live with my husband, I initially considered applying to an art school. 
          However, I realized that I wanted to keep art as a side gig and a personal passion rather than turning it into my main profession. 
          My husband, who is a software engineer, then suggested I explore ICT. He used to studied ICT at Fontys in Eindhoven, graduated, 
          and works professionally at the moment.
          <br>
          Through our shared passion for video games, he introduced me to the fascinating world of technology, and
          programming. Seeing how much people can achieve with just a computer sparked an interest in me,
          and I became eager to learn more. It's amazing how technology has evolved from early personal computers and dial-up internet 
          to today’s cloud services, AI, and smartphones. Seeing how these systems developed, and how they quietly power everyday life, 
          from online banking and logistics to healthcare, smart homes, and even the apps we use without thinking made ICT feel 
          both human and impactful.</p>
