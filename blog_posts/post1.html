        <p>My interest in ICT began through my husband, who is a software engineer and studied in the Netherlands. 
          Through our shared passion for video games, he introduced me to the fascinating world of technology, 
          programming, and problem-solving. Seeing how much people can achieve with just a computer sparked an interest in me,
          and I became eager to learn more. </p>
