        <p>One company in the ICT and gaming world that inspires me is Valve Corporation, the creator of the Steam platform. 
        Valve is unique because it is still an independent, privately-owned company, which means it doesn’t need to answer 
        to outside shareholders or follow any trends. Instead, it can focus on making products that players actually love.</p>

        <p>Steam is more than just a store, it has become the biggest digital distribution platform for PC games, 
        and it has shaped the entire gaming industry. I use Steam and even play on the Steam Deck most of the time, 
        which is one of the first PC handheld gaming console that run on Linux, so technically it’s also a mini PC! 
        I find it amazing that a single company can create both software and hardware that millions of people around the world use daily.</p>
        <p>Valve is also known for Counter-Strike, one of the most successful multiplayer games ever created. What began as a small mod 
    for Half-Life grew into a worldwide phenomenon. Today, Counter-Strike is a cornerstone of esports, with professional tournaments 
    watched by millions of fans around the globe and prize pools worth millions of dollars. This shows how a game built by passionate 
        developers can evolve into a cultural and competitive event on a global scale.</p>

        <p>The face of Valve is Gabe Newell, often called “Gaben” by fans. He is a great example of how people in ICT can change the world. 
        Gaben worked at Microsoft in the early days of Windows before founding Valve. His vision and leadership helped build not only 
        iconic games like Half-Life and Portal, but also an entire ecosystem through Steam that supports developers and gamers alike.</p>
        <p>For me, Valve and Gaben represent what I admire in ICT: creativity, innovation, and the power to connect people worldwide.</p>
