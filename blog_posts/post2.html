        <p>My strength is that I love working in a team, and I always try my best to complete my work. 
          I’m highly self-motivated and enjoy researching to deepen my understanding. 
          However, I usually find it hard to work effectively under pressure, and as someone without a background in ICT, 
          I’m aware that I have a long and challenging road ahead of me. Despite this, 
          I see many exciting opportunities to meet new people and fellow classmates who can broaden my perspective 
          and support my learning journey. At the same time, I acknowledge potential threats such as balancing with personal responsibilities, 
          as I already have a family of my own. I also need to deal with pressure and self-doubt, which might affect my pace. 
          Being aware of these factors helps me prepare and stay focused on my goals.</p>
