  <h1>My Programming Experience</h1>
  <p>I am new to ICT and just started my journey into the computer world recently. 
    Since I am a long-time video games enthusiast, I am quite familiar with computers 
    and a lot of gaming consoles. I also use a Steam Deck and have played with some mods and tweaks 
    to enhance my Steam Deck performance. Through my Steam Deck, I also got to know a bit about the Linux system.
    During my free time, I am learning the CS50 course, which is from Harvard University, and I am learning Python via boot.dev.
