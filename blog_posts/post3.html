        <p>I am new to ICT and just started my journey into the computer world recently. 
          Since I am a long-time video games enthusiast, I am quite familiar with computers and a lot of gaming consoles.
          I also use a Steam Deck and have played with some mods and tweaks to enhance my Steam Deck performance. 
          Through my Steam Deck, I also got to know a bit about the Linux system.
          During my free time, I follow the CS50 course, which is from Harvard University, and I am learning Python via boot.dev</p>
