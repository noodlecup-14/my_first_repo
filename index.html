    <title>My ICT Journey</title>

    <h1>Welcome to my page! ≽(•⩊ •マ≼ </h1>
    <h2>Why I chose ICT?</h2>
<p>I am a curious person, and to me, technology feels like magic as I am amazed at how people can build state-of-the-art devices that we are using every day from just 0 and 1. 
    <br>That is why I am motivated to dive deep into this field to unveil the logic and creativity of technology. 
    <br>I am excited to discover the many paths within ICT, from web development to data science or software engineering.
<br>This study program fits me because I’m a self-driven learner. I am not afraid to start from zero, as long as I have a clear goal and the right learning resources. 
<br><br>I truly believe that passion often grows as you improve at something, not before. 
<br>As Cal Newport says in <em>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</em>: <strong>“Working right trumps finding the right work.”</strong> 
<br>That is exactly how I approach ICT: I don’t expect to love it overnight, but I am excited to build skills and discover what parts of this field inspire me as I grow.</p>
<h2>My plan for the future?</h2>  
<ol>
    <li>Learn more about computer science basics</li>
    <li>Use free online resources like CS50 and boot.dev to support my learning.</li>
    <li>Connect with classmates and teachers to build a support network.</li>
    <li>Find a specialization during the four years that suits me best.</li>
    <li>Read more books to expand my thinking and inspiration.</li>
</ol>

<h2> Resources I'm using to learn more about ICT:</h2>
<p> In addition to my classes at Hz, I'm also learning independently through:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.boot.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boot.dev</a> — a hands-on platform to learn back-end development and computer science.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50x</a> — Harvard’s free and world-famous introduction to computer science course.</li>
</ul>
