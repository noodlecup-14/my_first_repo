      <h2>A bit about myself ‚îÄ‚îÄ .‚ú¶</h2>
      <p>I come from Vietnam and I have been living in the Netherlands for almost 2 years.
      <br> 
      I already finished my bachelor's degree in Business Administration back in Vietnam,
      but since I left my country, I want to refresh! 
      <br>
      Therefore, ICT was my choice of study to begin my new journey.</p>

      <h2>What I love ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö‚ô™ ùÑû‚ÇäÀö‚äπ</h2>
      <p>I <strong>love</strong> drawing, video games, and gardening. 
      <br>
      I have been a freelance illustrator for some years, and have worked as a 2D animator on a few commercials, TV series, 
      and movies for Japanese studios.
      <br>
      I am also a <em>die-hard</em> video games lover! 
      I got my first Game Boy Color back in 2000, along with Pok√©mon Red, when I was 5, 
      which sparked my love for video games. 
      Since then, I have been playing and collecting 
      a lot of video game consoles as well as merch like figures, artbooks, etc. 
      <br>
      I recently have a new hobby which is gardening. I began to grow veggies in my own garden for my 
      family in March, which has been a very interesting and joyful experience for me.</p>
