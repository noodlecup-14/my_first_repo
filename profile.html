      <h2>A bit about myself ‚îÄ‚îÄ .‚ú¶</h2>
      <p>I come from Vietnam and I have been living in the Netherlands for almost 2 years.
      <br> 
      I already finished my bachelor's degree in Business Administration back in Vietnam,
      but since I left my country, I want to refresh! 
      Therefore, ICT was my choice of study to begin my new journey.
      <br>
       I used to live in Eindhoven for more than one year and just recently moved to Roosendaal. 
       I have been studying Dutch and reached between level A2 and B1, so.. still a lot more to learn xD. </p>

      <h2>What I love ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö‚ô™ ùÑû‚ÇäÀö‚äπ</h2>
      <p>I <strong>love</strong> drawing, video games, and gardening. 
      <br>
      I have been a freelance illustrator for some years, and have worked as a 2D animator on a few commercials, TV series, 
      and movies for Japanese studios.
      <br>
      I am also a <em>die-hard</em> video games lover! 
      I got my first Game Boy Color back in 2000, along with Pok√©mon Red, when I was 5, 
      which sparked my love for video games. 
      Since then, I have been playing and collecting 
      a lot of video game consoles as well as merch like figures, artbooks, etc. Like me, my husband is also a huge fan of video games, 
      and so we usually play video games and discuss the gaming industry together. 
      <br>
      My favourite genre is RPG! I also play a lot of indie games, tactical games and visual novels. I love diving into the 
      fantasy world and discovering the creativity behind each game that I play. Some of my favourite games of all time are: 
      Nier Automata, Bloodborne, Monster Hunter, Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy, and The Legend of Zelda (it‚Äôs so hard to choose since there are just too many great games!)
      <br>
      At the moment, I'm playing Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 and a small puzzle game on Steam called Human Resource Machine. 
      It looks cute and simple, but under the hood it‚Äôs an ‚Äúassembly-like‚Äù programming playground that trains you to think like a developer.
      For a newbie like me, it gently introducing me to programming logic, and still play fun for anyone that enjoy puzzle games!
      <br>
      I recently have a new hobby which is gardening. I began to grow veggies in my own garden for my 
      family in March, which has been a very interesting and joyful experience for me.</p>
