                I am currently learning something new!~</h1>

            <h2>A bit about myself ‚îÄ‚îÄ .‚ú¶</h2>
              <p>I come from Vietnam and I have been living in the Netherlands for almost 2 years.
                <br> 
                I already finished my bachelor's degree in Business Administration back in Vietnam,
                 but since I left my country, I want to refresh! 
                 <br>
                Therefore, ICT was my choice of study to begin my new journey.</p>

            <h2>What I love ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö‚ô™ ùÑû‚ÇäÀö‚äπ</h2>
              <p>I <strong>love</strong> drawing, video games, and gardening. 
                <br>
                I have been a freelance illustrator for some years, and have worked as a 2D animator on a few commercials, TV series, 
                and movies for Japanese studios.
                <br>
                I am also a <em>die-hard</em> video games lover! 
                <br>
                I got my first Game Boy Color back in 2000, along with Pok√©mon Red, when I was 5, 
                which sparked my love for video games. 
                <br>
                Since then, I have been playing and collecting 
                a lot of video game consoles as well as merch like figures, artbooks, etc. 
                <br>
                I recently have a new hobby which is gardening. I began to grow veggies in my own garden for my 
                family in March, which has been a very interesting and joyful experience for me.</p>

            <video controls width="640"><source src="resources/showreel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            <p><em>I started to learn drawing and 2D animation five years ago from zero knowledge.
                <br>
            That is why I believe when that you set your heart for something, you can achieve it!
